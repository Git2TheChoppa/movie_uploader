# movie_uploader
aws s3 is annoying about uploading videos/pictures one at a time to the cloud. This script auto uploads all files to your bucket for you. 

#Note
if you have not done so already you will have to validate your boto3 / aws cli credentials on your computer the first time to be able to interact with aws programatically
